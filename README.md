# Steel-Defect-Detection

This repository is created for Severstal Steel Defect Detection Challenge. 

Solution split into 2 parts:
1. Predict image without mask.
2. Remove test image without mask and fit into another model to predict mask. This is to increase accuracy as most of the image had no mask.
